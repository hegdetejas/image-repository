# Tejas Hegde - Shopify Image Repository

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository that contains the code for the public image repository. `server.py` contains the web server 
that was built using Python. The backend was developed with the Flask framework and connects and stores all images in an Amazon
Web Services S3 Storage Bucket. I hope you enjoy it :)

## Further Steps

My aim for this project was to create a simple functioning public image repository that allows for the Add and Delete commands.
An interesting addition to this would be to limit role access through including login forms where access tokens can determine the
user and the displayed images. This would be added using the python-oauth2 framework within Python and allows for easy credential
verification using OAuth2.0.
